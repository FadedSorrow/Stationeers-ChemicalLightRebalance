# Stationeers-ChemicalLightRebalance

## What does it do?
The idea was to rebalance the chemical lights found in Stationeers.  The vanilla chemical lights are very insufficient and provide very little light.  So, we decided to pack them with a high intensity formula to allow for a longer, brighter burn making them more worthwhile to carry.  Since flashlights can drain your batteries quickly this provides a viable alternative to always using a flash light.

## How do I use it?
This repository is used in conjuntion with the BepInEx pluggin / modding framework found at https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx.  I am using the release 5.4.21 version.  You will need to follow the install instructions.  It is fairly straight forward and involves downloading the release to the root of the game directory (usually where the .exe is found), running the game once for it to configure things, one of which is a folder called plugins found <game directory root>/BepInEx/plugins.

From here you can place the release of this repository, found at https://github.com/FadedSorrow/Stationeers-ChemicalLightRebalance/releases/tag/v0.1.0.0, into the plugins folder and then run the game.  If you modified the BeInEx config to output logging to a console during the install of BepInEx you will be able to see if the mod loaded or not.
