	  [b]What does this mod do?[/b]
	  The idea was to rebalance the chemical lights found in Stationeers.  The vanilla chemical lights are very insufficient and provide very little light.  So, I decided to pack them with a high intensity formula to allow for a longer, brighter burn making them more worthwhile to carry.  Since flashlights can drain your batteries quickly this provides a viable alternative to always using a flash light.
